In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 120 years old.  

It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format: 
 * You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
 * Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

## Assumptions
    1 year = 365 days
    1 year = 52 weeks
    1 year = 12 months
