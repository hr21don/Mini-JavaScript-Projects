# 99-bottles-of-beer-challenge
How to make your computer recite the most boring song ever invented: [99BootlesOfBeer](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html)

## Starting Condition 
Start with 99 bottles.
Since both 99 and 98 are plural, both this round and next round are set to plural

## Iteration
Everytime we start a new round, we need to check if the current (and next) num is plural or singular.

## Stop Cases
The while loop will run until num = 0.
